# Port Scanner

## Description
The Port Scanner is a lightweight and efficient network utility designed to identify open ports on a specified target IP address. This tool is particularly useful for network administrators, security professionals, and anyone interested in assessing network security. With the ability to scan a defined range of ports, users can quickly determine which services are accessible on a target machine. By analyzing open ports, users can gain insights into potential vulnerabilities and improve their overall network security posture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Ensure you have Flask (or any other web framework you're using) installed. You can install it via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Running the Application
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. **Run the backend server** by executing the Python script:
   ```bash
   python <your-python-script>.py
   ```
4. **Open the frontend** in your web browser. You can usually do this by opening the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.

### Using the Port Scanner
- **Input the target IP address** you wish to scan.
- **Define the range of ports** to scan.
- **Click on the "Scan" button** to start the scanning process. 
- The results will be displayed on the webpage, showing the open ports and any relevant information.
