Port Scanner
Description
The Port Scanner is a lightweight and efficient network utility designed to identify open ports on a specified target IP address. This tool is particularly useful for network administrators, security professionals, and anyone interested in assessing network security. With the ability to scan a defined range of ports, users can quickly determine which services are accessible on a target machine. By analyzing open ports, users can gain insights into potential vulnerabilities and improve their overall network security posture.
